# TOTM_BasiCS_demo_01

STEM students! Want to add another technical skill to your resume? This month's TOTM (Theme of the Month) will cover Git! Come learn about what Git is and git better with commands. Git is frequently used in software engineering for version control and programming with a team, and adding them to your resume is a great way to set yourself apart from your peers. 

Don’t worry if you haven’t touched GitHub ever~ We’ll go through Git basics, and this workshop will also be a nice refresher for those who have used Git a few times but still need to review basic terminology. Students in intro CS/programming courses or anyone interested are welcome to join us!
